    <p>
        Invariant theory lives to describe the behavior of group actions on
        polynomial rings. The study began trying to describe binary forms.
        However, extending the techniques used, into the realm of multivariate
        polynomials, met many obstructions. Enter the dawn of the 20th century
        and David Hilbert.
    </p>

    <p>
        A linear algebraic group $G$ is some Zariski closed subgroup of
        $\operatorname{GL}(V)$, where $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space.
        Suppose that $X$ is some affine variety. A variety is an
        algebreo-geometric object that is determined by the vanishing of a finite
        number of polynomials $f_1, f_2, \cdots , f_k$. One can then consider
        the ring of regular functions on $X$:
        \[
            k[X] \cong k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/I(V)
        \]
        where the ideal $I(V)$ is determined by the polynomials $f_1, f_2, \cdots, f_k$
        up to radical.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1900, Hilbert asked wheter or not certain types of rings are finitely
        generated. He was able to prove the following statement for the general
        linear group.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Hilbert's 14th Problem:</b> If $G$ is a linear algebraic group, and
        $X$ an affine $G$-variety, is it true that the ring of invariants $k[X]^G$
        is finitely generated? (Here $k$ is the complex numbers.)
    </p>

    <p>
        It turns out that the answer to this question was in the negative. In
        the 1950's, Nagata found a counterexample. He gave a series of lectures
        on this topic, at the Tata Institute in 1965. The lecture notes can be
        found <a href="">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        So the statement, in general, was found to not hold. It does beg the question:
        With so many positive examples, does there exist a class of linear algebraic groups,
        for which Hilbert's 14th problem is true? The answer is yes! These linear
        algebraic groups are said to be <em> linearly reductive </em>; meaning that their
        representations can be broken down into building blocks called reducible
        representations.
    </p>

    <p> <b> Note:</b> It is perhaps natural to ask: Are there other types of
        linear algebraic groups beyond those that are linearly reductive? There
        are three notions that are interesting to this discussion:
        <ol>
            <li> Linearly Reductive </li>
            <li> Reductive </li>
            <li> Geometrically Reductive </li>
        </ol>
        It turns out, when working over characteristic zero fields, that linearly
        reductive and reductive are equivalent. This fails to hold when the characteristic
        of the field is $p > 0$. Haboush proved that Reductive and Geometrically
        Reductive are equivalent.
    </p>

    <p>
        The study of invariant theory lead to Hilber proving three major theorems:
        <ol>
            <li> The Nullstellensatz, which translates to "the zero places theorem" </li>
            <li> The Basissatz, which makes the statement that a polynomial ring over
            a Noetherian ring is finitely generated. </li>
            <li> A statement that is now known as the Syzygy theorem.
        </ol>
        These theorems have become fundamental in modern commutative algebra. With
        these facts proven, and the development of the symbolic method, invariant
        theory was thought to be dead.
    </p>

    <p>
        David Mumford brought invariant theory back into the fold of modern research
        mathematics, in the 1960's. Harkening back to the way we started this
        discussion: let $G$ be some linear algebraic group and $X$ some $G$-variety.
        Perhaps the immediate question one could ask: Do the orbits of the action
        have the structure of a variety? It turns out that the answer is no.
        However, one can form the categorical quotient $X//G$, by utilizing the
        closed orbits of a group action on a variety. This construction lead to
        inquiries and exploaration around objects called moduli spaces that parameterize
        certain types of geometric objects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Describing the ideas, in play, to study the ideas around categorical quotients
        causes difficulty. To even begin, one needs notions from algebraic geoemtry
        and the language of group actions. Beyond that, the theory is often quite subtle
        and technically difficult. An <em> affine variety </em> $V$ is a geometric
        object that can be described by the vanishing of a finite number of polynomials.
        A group $G$ is said to <em> act regularly </em> on $V$ if $G \times V \rightarrow V$
        defined by $(g,v) \mapsto g \cdot v$ is a morphism of varieties. A group action
        partitions $V$ into a collection of <em> orbits </em>, where an orbit is:
        \[
            \mathcal{O}_x = \{g \cdot x \mid g \in G\}.
        \]
        As stated, the "natural" question is:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Q:</b> Can the orbits of the action be viewed as a variety?
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> A:</b> Unfortunately, the answer to this is no.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is only the beginning of the difficulty that arises. A continued
        study of GIT leads one through such topics as the Hilbert Nullcone,
        stability conditions and criteria, and moduli spaces. These are all
        very important concepts, both in modern mathematics and theoretcial
        physics.
