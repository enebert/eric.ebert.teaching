    <p>
        It seems that almost every inquiry into an area of number theory begins
        with the fact that an integer can be uniquely factored into powers of primes, upto
        the order of the primes. In more general settings, one defines an element
        to be <em> prime </em> if $p \mid ab$ implies that $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$. Consider
        the ring of Gaussian integers:
        \[
            \mathbb{Z}[i] = \left\{a + bi \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}.
        \]
        What are the prime elements in this ring? A natural enough question that
        one can answer by working through the properties of the <em> norm </em>
        endowed on the ring $N(z) = z \cdot \bar{z}$, where $\bar{z}$ is the complex
        conjugate of $z$.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the following diagram of ring / field extensions:

        \[
            \require{AMScd}
            \begin{CD}
                \langle 1-i \rangle @>>> \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[i] @>>> K = \mathbb{Q}(i) \\
                @AAA @AAA @AAA \\
                \langle 2 \rangle @>{\phantom{\text{extension}}}>> \mathbb{Z} @>{\phantom{\text{extension}}}>> \mathbb{Q} \\
            \end{CD}
        \]
        Note that $2$ lies in the ideal $\langle 1-i \rangle$ because $(1+i)(1-i) = 2$. One
        says that $2$ is a <em> split </em> prime, in the extension, sense it factors.
        It turns out that there can only be finitely many such primes. There are
        three types of primes <em> split </em>, <em> ramified </em>, and <em> inert </em>.
        They are interesting enough, in isolation, but really one wants to use the behavior
        to study the ring, at large. One can then ask: does unique factorization hold in every number field $\mathcal{O}_K$?
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer turns out to be no. Not every number field is a unique factorization
        domain(UFD). However, they are <em> Dedekind domains </em>. These rings have
        suitably nice properties to recover a version of unique factorization. One looks
        at prime ideals instead of prime elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Theorem: </b> Every ideal, in a Dedekind domain, uniquely factors
        into a product of prime ideals, up to reordering of the factors.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is but the beginning of a very interesting story. In some ways,
        the "algebraic", in algebraic number theory, is a little bit of a misnomer.
        There are analytic notions that come into play, while proving certain theorems
        or trying to understand the structure of a number field. Two examples are the
        Dedekind Unit theorem and Dedekind Zeta functions. The Dedekind Unit theorem
        requires analysis, in its proof, but is ultimately a statement about the
        units in a number ring.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are a whole slew of ideas, some of which are pretty deep, that
        lead off into the realm of Class Field Theory. The <em> class number </em>
        tells one how far a number field is from being a PID, at least in some
        sense. The class number formula relates values of the Dedekind zeta
        function to invariants such as the <em> regulator </em> the <em> discriminant </em>,
        the number of the roots of unity in the number field, and the real and complex
        embeddings.
