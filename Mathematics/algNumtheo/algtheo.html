    <p>
        It seems that almost every inquiry into an area of number theory begins
        with the fact that an integer can be uniquely factored into powers of primes, upto
        the order of the primes. In more general settings, one defines an element
        to be <em> prime </em> if $p \mid ab$ implies that $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$. Consider
        the ring of Gaussian integers:
        \[
            \mathbb{Z}[i] = \left\{a + bi \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}.
        \]
        What are the prime elements in this ring? A natural enough question that
        one can answer by working through the properties of the <em> norm </em>
        endowed on the ring $N(z) = z \cdot \bar{z}$, where $\bar{z}$ is the complex
        conjugate of $z$.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the following diagram of ring / field extensions:

        \[
            \require{AMScd}
            \begin{CD}
                \langle 1-i \rangle @>>> \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[i] @>>> K = \mathbb{Q}(i) \\
                @AAA @AAA @AAA \\
                \langle 2 \rangle @>{\phantom{\text{extension}}}>> \mathbb{Z} @>{\phantom{\text{extension}}}>> \mathbb{Q} \\
            \end{CD}
        \]
        Note that $2$ lies in the ideal $\langle 1-i \rangle$ because $(1+i)(1-i) = 2$. One
        says that $2$ is a <em> split </em> prime, in the extension, since it factors.
        It turns out that there can only be finitely many such primes. There are
        three types of primes <em> split </em>, <em> ramified </em>, and <em> inert </em>.
        They are interesting enough, in isolation, but really one wants to use the behavior
        to study the ring, at large. One can then ask: does unique factorization hold in every number field $\mathcal{O}_K$?
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer turns out to be no. Not every number field is a unique factorization
        domain(UFD). However, they are <em> Dedekind domains </em>. These rings have
        suitably nice properties to recover a version of unique factorization. One looks
        at prime ideals instead of prime elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Theorem: </b> Every ideal, in a Dedekind domain, uniquely factors
        into a product of prime ideals, up to reordering of the factors.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is but the beginning of a very interesting story. In some ways,
        the "algebraic", in algebraic number theory, is a little bit of a misnomer.
        There are analytic notions that come into play, while proving certain theorems
        or trying to understand the structure of a number field. Two examples are the
        Dedekind Unit theorem and Dedekind Zeta functions. The Dedekind Unit theorem
        requires analysis, in its proof, but is ultimately a statement about the
        units in a number ring.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are a whole slew of ideas, some of which are pretty deep, that
        lead off into the realm of Class Field Theory. The <em> class number </em>
        tells one how far a number field is from being a PID, at least in some
        sense. The class number formula relates values of the Dedekind zeta
        function to invariants such as the <em> regulator </em> the <em> discriminant </em>,
        the number of the roots of unity in the number field, and the real and complex
        embeddings.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> The Dedekind Zeta Function: </b> We take a small look regarding the
        intersection between trying to uncover the algebraic structure of a
        number ring, and analytic techniques. As noted in the analytic number
        theory section, the Riemann-Zeta function is defined by:
        \[
            \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}, \text{ where   } \Re(s) > 1.
        \]
        There is an analog to this idea, taken from an algebraic point-of-view.
        It was Hecke who first defined the Dedekind-Zeta function, as follows:
        \[
            \zeta_K(s) = \sum_{I} \frac{1}{N(I)^s}
        \]
        where the sum is taken over the integral ideals in $\mathcal{O}_K$. One
        way to define the <em> norm </em> is by taking $N(I)$ to be the size of
        the quotient ring $\mathcal{O}_K/I$. Landau was able to prove the
        following analog to the Prime Number Theorem:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Prime Ideal Theorem: </b> Let $K$ be an algebraic number field. The
        number of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$, with $N(\mathfrak{p}) \leq x$ is
        asymptotic to $x/\log x$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Q: </b> If the Riemann-Zeta function and the Dedekind-Zeta function
        have the following traits in common:
        <ol>
            <li> They essentially have the same asymptotic behavior $x / \log x$. </li>
            <li> They are written as series that have a similar form.
        </ol>
        Is it possible to obtain any of the other analogs to Riemann-Zeta:
        <ol>
            <li> Does the Dedekind-Zeta function have an Euler product? </li>
            <li> Can we get extend $\zeta_K(s)$ to a meromorphic function? </li>
            <li> Can we write the Dedekind-Zeta function as a Dirichlet series
                $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{n^s}$ and if so, what are the $a_n$? </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Euler Product: </b> The intuition behind why there is an Euler product
        is via the generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again,
        we are using the fact that ideals factors uniquely in a Dedekind domain,
        along with the multiplicativity of the norm. This is the same idea used
        when studying Dirichlet series. We will avoid issues of convergence, to
        insure that we don't get bogged down in the technicalities and miss the story.
        Just as with the Riemann-Zeta function, the series representation
        \[
            \zeta_K(s) = \sum_{I} \frac{1}{N(I)^s}
        \]
        yields the product
        \[
            \prod_{\mathfrak{p}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{N(\mathfrak{p}^s)} + \frac{1}{N(\mathfrak{p}^{2s})} + cdots \right)
        \]
        where the product is taken over the prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ in the ring
        of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. The idea is that when the product is multiplied out
        term-by-term, each ideal $I$ will appear exactly once. Now notice that, for
        each prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$, the factor is a geometric series. This,
        at least intuitively, justifies our writing
        \[
            \zeta_K(s) = \prod_{\mathfrak{p}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{N(\mathfrak{p})^s} \right)^{-1}
        \]
        for $\Re(s) > 1$. The following theorem gives us an answer to (2), as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Theorem: </b> Let $K$ be a number field. Then $\zeta_k$ is a meromorphic
        function on the half-plane $\Re(s) > 1 - \frac{1}{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$, analytic
        everywhere except for the simple pole at $s=1$. Further,
        \[
            \zeta_K(s) = \sum_I \frac{1}{N(I)^s} = \prod_{\mathfrak{p}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{N(\mathfrak{p})^s})^{-1}
        \]
        with absolute convergence for $\Re(s) > 1$.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second question gives us a connection between the algebraic structure
        of $\mathcal{O}_K$, the analytic properties of $\zeta_K$, and the class
        number. It turns out that one can write
        \[
            \zeta_K(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{n^s}
        \]
        where the $a_n$ are the number of ideals with norm $n$. One can proceed
        from here to get the class number formula. See Marcus Chapter 7. In the
        exercises in Montgomery and Vaugh, the ideas above are formulated for
        what happens in for quadratic number fields.
