    <p>
        The topic of Topology revolves around studying mathematical shapes and
        abstracting concepts in Geometry. There are three major areas:
        <ol>
            <li> Point-Set Topology </li>
            <li> Algebraic Topology </li>
            <li> Differential Topology </li>
        </ol>
        All of these topics have results that are deep and geometrically
        beautiful. As with all mathematics, there is overlap in the topics,
        and trying to put any one inquiry into a box can prove troubling.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Algebraic Topology:</b> Given a geometric inquiry, it has proven
        fruitful to try and cast that into an algebraic problem, and then translate
        the results back into geometric notions. Three basic tools are:
        <ol>
            <li> Fundamental Group </li>
            <li> Homology </li>
            <li> Cohomology </li>
        </ol>
        Each of these tools, somehow counts, or provides a description of, the
        holes in a surface. The fundamental group is a group, but requires the
        use of a base point, for the calculations. This quickly becomes annoying,
        and one encounters the idea of homology, which does not require the use of
        a base point. The homology groups allow one to form a long exact sequence
        of homology, and calculate certain groups via the Siefert-van Kampen theorem.
        In differential geometry, one uses the deRham cohomology groups to understand
        vaious aspects of a surface. These groups, in some sense, tell how close
        the <em> closed forms </em> are to being <em> exact </em>.
    </p>

    <p> <b> Smooth Manifolds:</b>
        A <em> manifold </em> is a mathematical abstraction of a surface. The theory
        of smooth manifolds begins with a number of technicalities and language
        around making sure that there is an <em> atlas </em> that completely
        describes the manifold, via local patches. These patches allow one to
        use the analytic theory in $\mathbb{R}^n$, in this setting. One then
        works towards the definitions of <em> tangent spaces </em>, <em> vector
        fields </em>, and <em> flows </em>. In what follows, $M$ is an $n$-dimensional
        manifold, $T_pM$ the tangent space of $M$ at $p$, and $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
        a smooth function on $M$.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b> Morse Theory:</b> In an introduction to Calculus, one learns maximization
    and minimization methods, as an application of the first and second derivatives.
    From this, we know that interest in when the first derivative vanishes, and the
    sign of the second derivative are significant. How can one take these techniques
    into higher dimesions, and more abstract settings?
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a first step. A <em> critical point </em> of a smooth function
        $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a point $p \in M$ such that the differential
        $df_p: T_pM \rightarrow T_{f(p)}\mathbb{R}$ vanishes. This is the equivalent
        of the first derivative being zero.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a second step. The <em> Hessian </em> $H_p(f)$, of a smooth function
        $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, at a critical point $p$, is the symmetric
        bilinear mapping $H_p: T_pM \times T_pM \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by
        mapping $(v,w) \mapsto v_p (w' \cdot f)$, where $w'$ is an extension of $w$
        to an open neighborhood of $p$. The Hessian fulfills the role of the second
        derivative. Here are a couple of definitions:
        <ol>
            <li> The critical point $p$ is said to be <em> nondegenerate </em> if
                and only if $\det(H_p(f)) \neq 0$. </li>
            <li> A <em> Morse function </em> on a smooth manifold is a smooth
                function whose critical points are all nondegenerate.
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        The first example of a Morse function is usually that of the height
        function on a torus standing up. There are four critical points. If one
        considers dumping water and letting it "flow" over the torus, the water
        will flow from the maximum to the minimum. The only "stability" is at the
        critical point and any perturbation is "unstable" and will want to flow
        to more stable point, where it can come to rest. If one considers a similar
        scenario, with the "relative" maximum "inside" the torus, then it will flow
        down to the "relative" minimum. One can do a local decomposition into <em>
        stable </em> and <em> unstable </em> manifolds.
    </p>

    <p>
        The point, of all of this, is that Morse theory allows one to study the
        manifold via the smooth functions on $M$. Further, the Morse functions
        are dense in the set of smooth functions. Hence, given some smooth function,
        that is not a Morse function, we can approximate it via Morse functions,
        through small perturbations. The <em> Morse Lemma </em> states that there
        is a canonical way to write a function around a nondegenerate critical
        point.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is but the beginning of an extrodinarily interesting story. On a
        Riemmanian manifold $\langle M, g \rangle$, one can consider the negative
        gradient flow. Smooth functions decrease along gradient flow lines. It
        can then be shown that a flow line, of a smooth function $f$, begins and
        ends at a critical point. So, we again have a connection between what's happening
        analytically and the geometry of the manifold.
    </p>

    <p>
        A deep question: What if we are working on an infinite-dimensional
        manifold? As always, moving from the finite-dimensional situation to an
        infinite-dimesional situation leaves one with great difficulties. The
        ideas behind <em> Floer Homology </em> were developed by Andreas Floer,
        in the 1980's. He developed these ideas in pursuit of a proof to the
        Arnold conjectures. The Arnold conjectures are statements that take place
        in the setting of <em> symplectic manifolds </em>. It turns out that a
        symplectic manifold is, in some sense, very rigid and has to be even-dimensional.
        The various constructions of Floer homology led to major developments in
        answering open questions, in differential geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Remark: </b> If symplectic manifolds have to be even-dimensional, you
        may very well be asking yourself: What about odd-dimensional structures?
        The analog, if you will, is that of a <em> contact manifold </em>
    </p>

    <p>
        My personal experience, with the subject of Topology, was a difficult
        one. The first course usually delves deeply into the structure of
        point-sets. This involves a great deal of technicality, an understanding
        of set theory, and learning new language. The presentation of this
        material was done by regurgitation of the book onto an instructor's notes,
        and regurgitation of those notes onto a blackboard. This was immensely
        frustrating, as it ignored the threads that bind the subject together
        and provided little motivation.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I delved further into geometry, from an algebraic point-of-view, I
        became more curious about what the analytic picture looked like. This lead
        me to take an introduction to smooth manifolds. A course that once again
        contained multiple sequences of consume / regurgitate. My first course
        in Algebraic Topology was much the same way. They did serve a purpose,
        as an introduction to the language and definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
        My last semester of graduate school I did an independent study in Morse
        Theory. Through this study, the topological concepts I had been so
        frustrated by, in the past, finally came together. Having a context
        that interested me, provided motivations for the techniques learned, and
        allowed me to delve deeply. Morse theory was as compelling as my studies
        in representation theory. Sometimes patience is required, until a topic
        comes along that provides the proper context, and a mentor that's good
        for you.
