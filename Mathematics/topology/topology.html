        The topic of Topology revolves around studying mathematical shapes and
        abstracting concepts in Geometry. There are three major areas:
        <ol>
            <li> Point-Set Topology </li>
            <li> Algebraic Topology </li>
            <li> Differential Topology </li>
        </ol>
        All of these topics have results that are deep and geometrically
        beautiful. As with all mathematics, there is overlap in the topics,
        and trying to put any one inquiry into a box can prove troubling.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Algebraic Topology:</b> Given a geometric inquiry, it has proven
        fruitful to try and cast that into an algebraic problem, and then translate
        the results back into geometric notions. Three basic tools are:
        <ol>
            <li> Fundamental Group </li>
            <li> Homology </li>
            <li> Cohomology </li>
        </ol>
        Each of these tools, somehow counts, or provides a description of, the
        holes in a surface. The fundamental group is a group, but requires the
        use of a base point, for the calculations. This quickly becomes annoying,
        and one encounters the idea of homology, which does not require the use of
        a base point. The homology groups allow one to form a long exact sequence
        of homology, and calculate certain groups via the Siefer-van Kampen theorem.
        In differential geometry, one uses the deRham cohomology groups to understand
        vaious aspects of a surface. These groups, in some sense, tell how close
        the <em> closed forms </em> are to being <em> exact </em>.

        My personal experience, with the subject of Topology, was a difficult
        one. The first course usually delves deeply into the structure of
        point-sets. This involves a great deal of technicality, an understanding
        of set theory, and learning new language. The presentation of this
        material was done by regurgitation of the book onto an instructor's notes,
        and regurgitation of those notes onto a blackboard. This was immensely
        frustrating, as it ignored the threads that bind the subject together
        and provided little motivation.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I delved further into geometry from an algebraic point-of-view, I
        became more curious about what the analytic picture looked like. This lead
        me to take an introduction to smooth manifolds. A course that once again
        contained multiple sequences of consume / regurgitate. My first course
        in Algebraic Topology was much the same way. They did serve a purpose,
        as an introduction to the language and definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
        My last semester of graduate school I did an independent study in Morse
        Theory. Through this study, the topological concepts I had been so
        frustrated by, in the past, finally came together. Having a context
        that interested me, and provided motivations for the techniques learned,
        allowed me to delve deeply. Morse theory was as compelling as my studies
        in representation theory. Sometimes patience is required, until a topic
        comes along that provides the proper context, and a mentor that's good
        for you.
