    <p>
        One of the major accomplishments of the 20th century was the classification
        of the finite simple groups. A group is said to be <em> simple </em> if
        its only normal subgroups are the whole group and the group generated by
        the identity. This classification is extrodinarily deep and has a number
        of technical aspects. The proof of the Feit - Thompson theorem was around
        1200 pages, in its original form, by itself. There have been a number of
        techniques brought to bear on this problem, from algebraic geometry,
        quivers, and those behind Deligne-Lusztig theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first simple groups that one encounters are the cyclic groups of prime
        order. A standard exercise in an undergraduate group theory course is
        showing that $C_p$ (the cyclic group of order $p$ written multiplicatively)
        is simple. One's second encounter with simple groups often comes from the
        study of the alternating groups $A_n$, for $n \neq 4$. Incidentally, a
        little invariant theory comes up in showing that $A_n$ is not <em> solvable </em>,
        for $n \geq 5$. One then concludes that there is not closed form, in elementary
        functions, for the roots of a polynomial of degree five or larger.
    </p>

    <p>
        The vast majority of the finite simple groups are those of <em> Lie type </em>.
        The <em> projective special linear group </em>, denoted $\operatorname{PSL}(n,q)$,
        for $n \geq 3$, and $q=p^n$ the power of some prime, provides us with an example
        of a simple group of Lie type.
    </p>

    <p> Let $G = \operatorname{GL}(n,q)$.
        Here are some of the standard ideas that get one started in this area:
        <ol>
            <li> <b> Borel Subgroups: </b> Let $B$ be the set consisting of all invertible
            upper triangular matrices in $G$. This is the <em> standard Borel
            subgroup </em>. More generally, a <em> Borel subgroup </em> is some
            conjugate of $B$. </li>
            <li> <b> $(B,N)$-pair:</b> One says that a group $G$ has a $(B,N)$-pair
            if there are subgroups $B, N \subseteq G$ such that:
                <ol>
                    <li> $G$ is generated by $B$ and $N$ </li>
                    <li> $H := B \cap N$ is normal in $N$, and the quotient $W := N/H$
                        is a group generated by a set $S$ of elements of order 2. </li>
                    <li> $n_sBn_s \neq B$ if $s \in S$ and $n_s$ a representative of
                        $s \in N$. </li>
                    <li> $n_sBn \subseteq Bn_snB \cup BnB$, for any $s \in S$ and $n \in N$. </li>
                    <li> $\bigcap_{n \in N} nBn^{-1} = H$.
                </ol>
            The group $W$ is called the <em> Weyl group </em> of $G$.
            </li>
            <li> <b> Bruhat Decomposition: </b> Suppose that the group $G$ admits a $(B,N)$-pair.
             We have the double-coset decomposition:
            \[
                G = \coprod_{w \in W} Bn_wB.
            \]</li>
            <li> <b> Frobenius Map: </b> We begin by supposing that $k$ is the algebraic
            of a finite field of $p$ elements, for a prime $p$. There is a subfield of $k$
            such that there are $q = p^m$ elements, denoted $\mathbb{F}_q$. Then
            we can consider the map $F_q: k \rightarrow k$ defiend by $x \mapsto x^q$.
            We then have the <em> standard Frobenius map </em> on affine space:
            \[
                k^n \rightarrow k^n \text{ given by } (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mapsto (x_1^q, \ldots, x_n^q).
            \]
            One can then consider the fixed point set:
            \[
                V^{\mathbb{F}_q} = \{v \in V \mid F_q(v) = v \} = V \cap \mathbb{F}_q^n
            \]
            where $V \subseteq k^n$ is some closed subset. There's quite a bit of
            work to move forward from here. (See Geck's book Ch. 4)
         </li>
        </ol>
        The last three definitions are as given in Geck's book referenced below.
    </p>

        A large amount of work, in this area, was done by Chevalley, Steinberg,
        and Tits. I was introduced to the standard examples early in my
        mathematical career. It was from my desire to understand a small part of
        the classification of finite simple groups, that I sat down and learned
        the methods behind the construction of the Suzuki groups. There is much
        more to explore in the future!
