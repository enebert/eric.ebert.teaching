    Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space. If $G$ is a group, then
    a representation is a group homomorphism $\rho: G \rightarrow \operatorname{GL}(V)$.
    Each element $G$ corresponds to some invertible linear transformation.
    This induces an action, of the group $G$, on the vector space, where
    we write $g \cdot v = \rho(g)(v)$. Using this action, we say that
    $V$ is a $G$-module.

    Mathematicians try to classify the objects that they are studying. It
    is always nice if we can understand how and why two entities are different.
    At least one reason for this, is to take something complicated and identify
    it with something that we understand very well. One of the major
    accomplishments of the twentieth century was the classification of finite
    simple groups. Representation theory played a big role in this work.
    The classification is broken down into:
    <ol>
        <li> Finite cyclic abelian groups </li>
        <li> The alternating groups </li>
        <li> Simple groups of Lie Type </li>
        <li> Sporadic Groups </li>
    </ol>
    Classification problems are interesting enough, but are often highly
    technical. One of the fundamental theorems used to classify finite groups
    is the Feit-Thompson theorem which says that every finite group of odd
    order is solvable. The proof is some 255 pages long.

    One way that representation theory manifests itself naturally is in the
    study of symmetries. One of the first finite groups one encouters in
    an abstract algebra course is that fo the dihedral groups. These are
    the symmetries of regular polygons. If one envisions a square in the
    plane, the rotation of 90 degrees is a symmetry of the square. Another
    symmetry is that of a reflection. These are both natural ideas that are
    studied to some extent in High School geometry. It turns out that the
    square has eight symmetries, and can be realized by the rotation of 90
    degrees, a fixed reflection, and all combinations of these two elements.
    \[
      D_8 = \langle r, s \vert r^4 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1} \rangle
    \]
    This presentation tells us that if we rotate the square four times we
    get back to where we started, and the same if we reflect the square
    twice. The last relation tells us that the rotation $r$ and the
    reflection $s$ do not commute. That is $rs \neq sr$. There is another
    presentation of this group using only reflections. Here is how the
    dihedral group of order eight is presented as a Coxeter group
    \[
      D_8 = \langle \alpha, \beta \vert \alpha^2 = \beta^2 = (\alpha \beta)^4 = 1 \rangle
    \]
    </p>

    These ideas arise in both chemistry and physics. Chemists use representations
    to study the structure and symmetries of crystals for instance. Physics
    researchers are interested in representations in the study of particle physics.

        <b> Modular Representation Theory:</b> One of the goals of representation
        theory is to describe all of the indecomposable representations, of a
        finite group $G$. The indecomposables are the building blocks of the
        representation. The easiest ones to understand are the simple
        representations. An introduction to the representation theore of finite
        groups is usually done over the complex numbers. Most of these methods
        can be extended to the situation where the characteristic of the field does
        not divide the order of the group. This is the so-called <em> Ordinary
        Representation Theory</em>. Maschke's theorem says that every ordinary
        representation can be decomposed into simples.
    </p>

    <p>
        Modular representation theory strives to understand the case when the characteristic
        of the field divides the order of the group. The following results hold in
        ordinary representation theory, and all fail in the modular case:
        <ol>
            <li> Maschke's Theorem (The decomposition into simples.) </li>
            <li> Hochster - Eagon Theorem (The ring of invariants is Cohen-Macaulay)</li>
            <li> The surjectivity of the transfer homomorphism </li>
        </ol>
        The methods required, in modular representation theory, include Brauer's
        Main Theorems, Brauer characters, representations of associative algebras
        along with quiver theory, and block theory. The Sylow $p$-subgroups play
        a large role in understanding the behavior of a $kG$-module. Understanding
        the so-called <em> defect blocks </em>, gives a notion of how far away
        the representation is from decomposing into simples, in some sense.
    </p>

        <b> Quiver Theory:</b> A quiver $Q$ is a directed graph and a representation
        of $Q$ is where a vector space is attached to each vertex and a linear
        mapping to each arrow. This seemingly simple idea leads to very deep results.
        An expository article by Derksen and Weyman can be found <a href = "http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-weyman.pdf"> here.</a>
        It turns out that every finite-dimesnional basic associative algebra can be
        realized as a path algebra $\operatorname{mod}$ some ideal. A result of Drozd says that
        every finite-dimensional associative algebra is either of:
        <ol>
            <li> Finite Type </li>
            <li> Tame Type </li>
            <li> Wild Type </li>
        </ol>
        Furthermore, these types are all mutually exclusive. It is know that the
        classification of the indecomposables of a wild representation is a
        hopeless task.
    </p>

    <p>
        I found the study of quivers and finite-dimesional algebras quite compelling.
        My enjoyment stemmed from the fact that som many areas of mathematics
        come together in the problems that arise. Quiver theory involves results from
        algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, geometric
        invariant theory, and homological algebra. It was in a course in quiver theory
        that I got my introduction to geometric invariant theory.

    Here are some notes, from a series of talks, that I gave on modular
    representation theory:
