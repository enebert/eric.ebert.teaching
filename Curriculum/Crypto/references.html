            <p>
                Linear Algebra has become a staple of the undergraduate curriculum. It's
                importance has been ever increasing with applications in optimization and
                computation. It's prevalence in both theoretical and applied mathematics
                means that a linear algebra course can be taught from many differnt directions.
                This has given me the opportunity to craft the course towards the student's
                interests. To the left, you will find some of the resources to the course.
                Below you will find some of my thoughts on the points-of-view taken, while
                teaching the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Seminar Style:</b> The course is modeled after what one might experience
                when taking an undergraduate math seminar. We meet three days a week, homework
                is due every two or three weeks, and we discuss our topic for the day during
                class meetings. If you were to visit us, you would see students working
                problems at the board 85% of the time. Having students acitvely engaged,
                in the classroom, gives them an opportunity to show what they know, work
                through items that they may not fully grasp, and have practice communicating
                mathematical ideas. As the course is a year long, I have broken it into three
                parts:
                <ol>
                    <li> Developing the basic skills needed to work with linear algebra.</li>
                    <li> Building the toolbox with advanced concepts.</li>
                    <li> Straight Seminar with a creative component. </li>
                </ol>
                Part one takes roughly 15 weeks, and covers the material one would find in a
                typical undergraduate linear algebra course. We work through the better part
                of Gilbert Strang's <i>Introduction to Linear Algebra</i>. We have
                homework, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Part two is about building the tools
                students need to complete a project at the end of the course. We
                do this through reading a paper and introducing students to topics that
                they maybe interested in pursuing during the end of the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What is Linear Algebra?</b> Any attempt to answer this question will inevitably
                leave out someone's favorite application. It's study began with the desire to
                solve systems of linear equations. This dates back to the work of
                Leibniz, Cramer, and Gauss in the 18th century. It was through
                Sylvester, in the 19th century, that the idea of a matrix became formalized
                and the notion of a linear may first came up. Grassman introduced
                the notion of a Grassman algebra, which really wasn't appreciated at the time.
                Through the works of Cayley and Frobenius, the subject found firm footing,
                in the realm of matrix equations and the early notions of representation theory.
                The idea of dimension we find intuitive is that used in linear algebra.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the 20th century dawned, there was a realization that the ideas
                of linearity could be found in other spaces as well. Lebesgue introduced
                the concept of measure, revolutionary in itself, and eventually spawned
                the study of function spaces. Function spaces are examples of infinite-dimensional
                vector spaces. Two special cases are that of the Banach space and the Hilber space.
                The Hilbert space makes its appearance in Quantum mechanics. As one
                would expect, having infinite dimensions can make life quite complicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Applications:</b> It is through the growth of computers and
                computational mathematics that linear algebra has found a home
                in applied mathematics. There is a whole topic of <i>Numerical Linear
                Algebra</i>, where one can study the nuances and difficulties of computing
                the objects in linear algebra. Such items include, but certainly
                aren't limited to: LU, QR, and SVD decompositions, the eigenvalue problem,
                discrete Fourier transform, and wavelets. Each of these items holds
                an important place in applied mathematics. For example, the Fast
                Fourier Transform makes its appearance in signal processing,
                the Discrete Fourier Transform in image compressions, and solutions
                to partial differential equations. For students who are interested
                in computer programming and computations, these topics give them the
                opportunity to learn linear algebra, implement algorithms, and have
                concrete results for their work.
