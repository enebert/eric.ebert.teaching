                My favorite aspect of teaching cryptography is the interdisciplinary
                nature of the subject. The most successful students use mathematical,
                language arts, and computer skills in tandem. Other areas that overlap
                with the subject are engineering, ethics, history, and politics. The course
                requires that students are able to communicate technical ideas in both
                written and oral form.
            </p>

            <p>
                I teach the course by taking two journeys concurrently. One is a journey
                from classical cryptography through mini-examples of modern day methods.
                The other is mathematical that includes modular arithmetic, group theory,
                matrix operations, and elliptic curves. I usually alternate the lessons
                on cryptographic theory with those on mathematical theory so that students
                don't get burnt out by either.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have never taught the course the same way twice. This has been, in part,
                because the access I have to a computer lab has been variable. There are
                some very good free tools available such as CrypTool and CoCalc. Students
                can used the cloud based CrypTool to test out theories, experiment with
                various protocols, and do analysis on a piece of ciphertext efficiently.
                It is slightly anachronistic to use 21st century technology to crack
                19th century codes, but it is easy to get worn out doing the pencel-and-paper
                method. Much like calculator use, there is an appropriate time to introduce
                computation into the course.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since cryptography is such a multidisciplinary subject, it appeals
                to a great number of students. For those of us that played spy as
                youngsters, we are a little bit nostalgic for the days of lemon juice,
                rail ciphers, and outwitting the "enemy", in the backyard. Living in
                a post-9/11 world brings us back to the present. I believe that the
                relevance of cryptography in our daily lives is another reason for the
                appeal of the course. The security of a cryptographic system and the fate
                of nations has gone hand-in-hand throughout history. The crossover of so
                many different disciplines makes the coures easy for me to adjust
                depending on student's interest. It's a joy to teach the course.
