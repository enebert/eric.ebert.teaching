                The resources for linear algebra abound. Listed below are the
                references that are or have sat on my desk shelf. Interlibrary
                loan is a wonderful resource.

                This is the main textbook for the first portion of the course. It takes a very
                computational and smooth approach. Getting students comfortable with
                computations is important, for a couple of reasons. First, they are
                forced to use the objects under discussion even if the student's interest
                is theoretical. Second, they are able to see tangible results to their work.
                Linear algebra is often the first encounter with proof writing, and can be a
                little intimidating. I've found that computations enhance a student's
                repertoire of examples, which is helpful when trying to prove a statement.

                Unfortunately the cost of this book has become astronomically high. If you
                can find used copies, it is well worth the effort. He covers some
                advanced topics more throughly than what is found in his introductory book.
                Topics I tend to cover are:
                <ul>
                    <li> The matrix exponential.</li>
                    <li> Maxima / minima of multivariate functions as an application of
                        definite and semi-definite matrices.</li>
                    <li> Numerical linear algebra topics such as matrix norms, the eigenvalue
                        problem, and time permitting the simplex method and duality.
                </ul>
            </p>

                I thought this was a very different approach, when I first encountered
                the book. Teaching from the book served to confirm this. I used this
                during a Winter trimester after a student expressed interest in
                learning more about polynomials. The student had a background in
                writing proofs and using mathematical structures through a summer program
                at MIT. We worked through aspects of this book, and neither one of us
                regretted it. We both agreed that it was a challenging read. Fuhrmann
                begins with the notion of rings and modules and uses $\mathbb{F}[z]$-modules
                extensively. The book is geared toward those with an interest in functional
                analysis and interpolation problems. He ends the book with a discussion
                regarding Rational Hardy Spaces. The style is terse, requires maturity,
                and an interest in the subject matter.

                I find this useful for a couple of reasons. He writes in a more mathematically
                sophisticated way. It is a good contrast to what is done in Strang's book.
                My students have all said they appreciate the style after an introduction through
                Strang. Topics not covered in Strang's book are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Spectral Theory</li>
                    <li>Bilinear and Quadratic Forms</li>
                    <li>Dual Spaces</li>
                    <li>A dose of multilinear algebra</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Other Books:</b> Here are some other books that I have found useful:

                <b>Papers:</b> I've used papers in some form or another to get
                students familiar with reading technical matheamtics and working
                with abstraction. Here are some papers that my students have read.
                Expository papers are available, but one does have to put the effort
                into finding them. It's easy to walk off the deep-end and assign
                something that a student doesn't have the background to read.
            </p>

            <p>
                <font face="Trebuchet MS">Axler, Sheldon, <i>Down with Determinatns</i></font>
            </p>
            <p>
                His point-of-view is that determinants are esoteric objects which are
                difficult to understand. There is little reasoning behind the why or
                the way they are computed. So, students go through these computations
                mindlessly and the thread of what they should be learning gets interrupted.
                I'm not sure that I disagree with this sentiment, but proving the statements
                without determinants takes a comfort level with abstraction that students
                are often not ready for, in a first course. This is the first paper I have
                students read as an introduction to abstraction, at this level, and getting
                them familiar with reading more technical literature.
