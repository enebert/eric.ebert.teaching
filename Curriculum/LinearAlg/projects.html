            <p>
                I believe heavily in writing and speaking across the curriculum.
                Students need to be able to communicate technical ideas and solutions
                to problems clearly, confidently, and concisely. It was with this
                in mind, and the fact that I also like the idea of alternative
                assessment, that the projects came about. Students, in the third
                phase of the course, are required to give an oral presentation
                and a written report. I give a description of the projects below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Projects give students to go in a direction that they want to explore.
                Giving students options and guidance, to complete a project in their
                realm of interest, allows them to bring their own enthusiasm and
                creativity to the table. It makes me smile.
            </p>

            <p><b> Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: </b>
                The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra has a fascinating history, as
                there are well over 100 proofs that use distinct methods. This
                project was based on the paper:
                <ul>
                    <li>Derksen, Harm, <i>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and
                        Linear Algebra</i>, Amer. Math Monthly <b>110</b>(2003),
                        620-623</li>

                    <li> Keith Conrad's distillation of the paper can be found
                        <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/fundthmalg/fundthmalglinear.pdf"> here </a>.
                </ul>
                This made a great way to study the theorem as:
                <ul>
                    <li> It's a proof by induction with nontrivial base case</li>
                    <li> It's an application of the properties of the space of
                        Hermitian matrices.</li>
                    <li> Commuting linear maps between complex symmetric matrices.</li>
                </ul>
                These are all interesting and exciting topics that sometimes get
                shorted in linear algebra courses.
            </p>

            <p><b> Manifolds: </b>
                The student who completed this project knew that he wanted to
                study theoretical mathematics in college. He had taken multivariable
                calculus, and we discussed the notions behind rings and modules
                earlier in the course. In the study of manifolds, one runs into
                modules over the ring of smooth functions rather regularly. The
                plan of study for this project is <a href=ManifoldProject.pdf>
                here</a>.
            </p>

            <p><b> Iterative Methods: </b>
                Python implementations of iterative methods. These iterative
                methods are used to solve systems of linear equations and to find
                the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated to a particular matrix.
                The QR-factorization and Cholesky factorization play a role in these
                methods. The results that he will be talking about, and the algorithms
                he’s implemented, can be found in the following two papers:
                <ol>
                    <li><i>Iterative Methods for Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</i> – Maysum Panju</li>
                    <li><i>Singular Values Using Cholesky Decomposition</i> – Aravindh Krishnamoothy, Kenan Kocagoez</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p><b> Least-Squares Problems: </b>
                Working through aspects of least squares, which has applications
                in statistics and curve fitting data. Least squares also give a
                framework for doing approximations in a finite-dimensional inner-product
                space. The presentation consisted of the exercises and computational
                details to a chapter from <i>Exercises in Computational Mathematics
                    with MATLAB</i> by Lyche and Merrien.
