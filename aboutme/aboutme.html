                obsession with pizza and Mexican foods especially. I go through
                cooking phases. These are often connected to ethnic interests
                such as Asian and Indian foods. As much as I enjoy cooking for
                myself and trying new things out, I enjoy cooking for others a
                great deal. There are few things more enjoyable than sitting
                around the table with good friends / family and good food.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">I also enjoy reading European Literature.
                 I've been a life-long reader, but my particular interest in
                 European Literature is a consequence of two courses I took as
                 an undergraduate. They were a World Lit and a French Lit &amp;
                 Philosophy course that had an ecology focus. I took these
                 courses to satisfy Gen Ed requirements, but they were much more
                 than breadth courses for me. In both courses, thinking was
                 encouraged, creativity was developed, and the professors cared
                 about their craft.</p>

                      Poetry
                    </h4>
                  <p class="card-text">Writing has always been an outlet for me. It is an opportunity
                  to explore ideas, express what's in my mind, and reflect on experiences. Poetry
                  has the capacity to touch the inner parts of our soul. In High School, poetry
                  was usual about dissecting a piece until it lost all of its meaning. As an adult,
                  I've been able to reconsider this art form, and capture expierences in a meaningful way.</p>

                    </h4>
                  <p class="card-text">A nice element of satisfying GenEd credit at UIowa was that
                  there were a number of options to accomplish the requirement. I decided to
                  take clarinet lessons for three semesters, as I was finishing up my math
                  degree. We started with the skills I had, and progressed from there. I was
                  given pieces to play that challenged me, but I was never expected to play
                  more that I was capable of. The desire to progress, and a substantial work ethic
                  were the expectations. There is a mindfulness component to playing an instrument.
                  It was the first time I heard the phrase, "boredom is a lack of engagement."
                  Sometimes we need to slow down in order to completely take in everything that
                  we are doing, studying, or producing.</p>

                    </h4>
                  <p class="card-text">The three most important questions I ever asked myself are:
                  1) What is my self talk costing me? 2) What narrative in my head can I
                  tell in a more positive manner? and 3) Why do I teach? I'm a
                  hyper-reflective individual and find it important to take time to
                  reflect on what's working, what needs to change, and to understand
                  what the healthiest choices are. To teach effectively, I have to take
                  care of myself, demonstrate the attitudes that I want to see, and
                  show the positive way forward.</p>

                      Military History
                    </h4>
                  <p class="card-text">I began reading military history during my last two years
                  in the Marine Corps. Reading reflections and stories of soldiers past, one
                  recognizes that, in some aspects, the military life hasn't changed that much.
                  On the other hand, technological and social changes have often come through the
                  military. History gives us an opportunity to reflect, learn, and discern. I came
                  to realize that all people feel a certain amount of stress, anxiety, and indecision,
                  when given their first leadership post. Fear can often be a good GPS for the direction
                  we should be going. "The things that I want to do most in life scare me and excite me
                  at the same time." -Unknown</p>
