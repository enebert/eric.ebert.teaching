    <p>
        I spent four years studying mathematics, at the University of Missouri - Columbia,
        under <a href = "#"> Dr. Calin Chindris</a>. I came to graduate school
        knowing nothing about representation theory. During my second year, I got
        and introduction to <a href = "#">Classical Invariant Theory </a> from Calin, and
        and introduction to linear representations of finite groups through an
        expository paper I wrote for a number theory course. I focused on various aspects
        of representation theory for the remainder of my graduate studies. Beyond the
        research business, there were a number of other growth experiences described
        below.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Teaching:</b> Graduate students come to graduate school with all
        kinds of motives, goals, and desires. I spent two years working an after
        school program, at a Catholic elementary school. During the summer, I
        had worked summer programs, through Johns Hopkins, Center for Talented
        Youth (CTY). Hence, I came to graduate school having worked with young
        students. I developed an interest, in teaching, and wanted to develop
        that skill. Little did I know that a number of my colleagues would view
        teaching as a punsihment.
    </p>

    <p>
        There were difficulties adjusting to teaching in the collegiate environment.
        I found that students brought there own expectations and baggae into the
        classroom. While I understood this would be the case abstractly, I got a
        quick education in supporting students, making expectations clear, and
        helping students work through there own frustrations. What I came to find,
        was that there are common themes that run through all teaching experiences
        no matter what the age group or the situation. At least three of these
        are:
        <ol>
            <li> Students need consistent expectations. </li>
            <li> Students need an environment that is conducive to learning. </li>
            <li> Students have latent abilities they aren't aware of, and need
            room to discover them.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        I had the opportunity to discuss the craft, of teaching, with one of the
        course coordinators, and a couple of professors. Having individuals
        willing to mentor me, in the classroom, and support me while I navigated
        new encounters was important. Those interactions and discussions helped
        me develop as a teacher, a person, and discover my inner love for helping
        others discover their own mathematical story. It was through one of these
        discussions that I first said: <q>School should not be the place where creativity comes to die.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Research:</b> Ah, the research business! The excitement comes from
        an engaging a brand new puzzle, and trying to put it together. While
        researchers are often trying to answer questions that no one has the answer to,
        it can be equally interesting to open closed problems, and come to an
        understanding of the techniques and ideas used to solve said problems.
        The people that are around you and discussing results, techniques, and
        ideas, with you, are as important as the inquiry itself. As a professor
        once said to me, <q>The best situation is when you're around people who
            ask you interesting questions.</q>

    </p>

    <p>
        Research feeds the mind. From an outside perspective, it may seem like
        mathematicians are studying a random set of questions. This is hardly
        ever the case. Problems don't arise in a vacuum. They often arise in one
        of two contexts:
        <ol>
            <li> Related to a long open problem that is deep seeded in the area. </li>
            <li> Is the natural next step or a continuation of a current research
                problem. </li>
        </ol>
        Sometimes the response to hearing about a research question is, "that sounds hard."
        This is precisely the reason I enjoyed the research arena. There has never
        been anything that engages my brain, in that way.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Interdisciplinary Inquiry:</b> When I began, as an undergraduate computer
        engineering student, all I heard about was the need to work collaboratively
        and interdisciplinary. There is a great joy, when one gets the opportunity
        to bring techinques and ideas, from different areas of mathematics, down
        on a problem. What I came to discover, was that this was not a skill that
        academia valued. University Deans generally wanted to be able to say that a
        faculty member is an expert in a particular field, and has written <em>x</em>
        number of papers, in that area. This was but an instance of what frustrated
        me about the politics in the academy.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a mathematician, I want to be thinking about interesting questions. I
        personally don't care if those questions have a direct application to a
        "real world" application. I have a deep interest in cryptography, which
        may be one of the most interdisciplinary areas: history, mathematics, politics,
        computer science, and engineering. I later developed an interest in
        bioinformatics and hope to have some time to further explore this area.
    </p>

    <p>
        I came to find that I found great enjoyment engaging the various areas of
        mathematics. I feel like I often gained insight exploring ideas, such as group
        theory, that appear in areas like algebraic topology and differential geometry.
        Seeing how things are the same, i.e. using ideas I've already been exposed to,
        and different, that is how an algebraic structure can expose insight into
        the geometry, at hand. This kind of idea lead me to request an independent
        study in Morse theory, where I came to a new kind of understanding about
        differential geometry.
