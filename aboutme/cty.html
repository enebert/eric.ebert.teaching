    <p>
        <b> Summer Programs: </b> The Center for Talented Youth (CTY) is a program,
            for talented students aged 12-16, through Johns Hopkins University.
            There are various sites on both the East and West coasts that JHU
            pays to use the facilities of a local college. I have had a wide
            range of experiences, but ultimately the opportunity, to teach an
            undergraduate mathematics course to an engaged group of student, keeps
            me coming back. It was at CTY that I realized one of the reasons that
            I teach is to "send the elevator back down". It is an opportunity to
            mentor students, and help TAs that are looking to start a career in
            mathematics and / or teaching.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students take one course during a three week session. There are two
        sessions per summer. I have typically worked two session summers. The
        students day goes something like:
        <ol>
            <li> 9:00-12:00   Class</li>
            <li> Lunch </li>
            <li> 1:00 - 3:00   Class </li>
            <li> Activities </li>
            <li> 7:00 - 9:00  Study Hall </li>
        </ol>
        I have taught a mathematical cryptography course, except the one summer
        I TA's for a Set Theory course. I enjoy the opportunity to introduce
        students to some of my favorite topics in mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> CTYired:</b> The first time I saw this term was on a Facebook posting
        of a friend. It is difficult to describe the CTY experience. Everything
        happens very quickly. Coming to the end of a session is some combination
        of exhaustion, wired, and tired. I recall being two weeks plus, into a
        session at LA, having a Mt. Dew and a Snickers bar, and still taking a
        two hour nap before dinner.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> The Family Reunion: </b> It is interesting where one ends up seeing
        staff members, from former summers. I spent a couple of summers in Seattle
        and later saw some of those instructors at Lancaster, PA a few years later.
        I ran into an academic dean, from Saratoga Springs, unexpectedly in Seattle,
        after seven years. We are all somehow wired for adventure, and having multiple
        sites allows one to have many different adventures. The sites all have
        a different local culture, but the same institutional knowledge, if that
        makes sense. It's a great way to meet new people, and develop new friends
        and colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Professional Growth: </b> We need opportunities to grow as professionals.
        In order to do that, we need to disturb our routine, at least a little.
        I've found that teaching at CTY provides a proper amount of disruption.
        Inquisitve students force me to reconsider concepts, from a different
        perspective. Staff who are naturally inquisitve and passionate about
        their area provide learning opportunities, from experts. I've also been
        fortunate to have quality administrators willing to mentor me in my own
        journey.
