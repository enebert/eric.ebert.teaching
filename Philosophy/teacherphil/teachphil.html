          <b>Dare to Explore.</b> Exploration begins with a question; an act
          of wonder. Such curiosity makes the neurons, in our brain, fire resulting
          in many more questions. A few of these questions will converge to a single
          question or a few guiding questions, while others are left for a different
          moment in time. The search is on! Where do we begin to look for answers?
          Can we use a process to approximate a result or simply get started down
          the path?
     </p>

     <p>
         I <i>wonder</i> what would happen if students composed questions, on their own?
         What if every teacher’s reaction to questions was, “let’s try and figure
         it out”? What would happen if we stopped limiting ourselves to learning
         what some author chose to put in a textbook, and we chose to step up and
         peer over the edge instead? Looked into the darkness and asked:
         What’s down there?
     </p>

     <p>
         <b>Witness Discovery.</b> Discovery often elicits joy and bewilderment
         at the same time. Joy comes with the knowledge gained and completing a
         task. The bewilderment as the brain continues to process the newness and
         organize the lessons, of the experience. This often results in new questions
         and the need to see if there is more to be uncovered. If we dig a little
         deeper together, will we find more?
     </p>

     <p>
         I <i>wish</i> we would stop compartmentalizing what students are supposed to know.
         I very distinctly remember a fourteen-year-old student stating, “This is
         probably beyond what I can understand at this point,” as we discussed
         the mathematics behind quantum cryptography. At fourteen you are not
         supposed to try and understand Hilbert spaces. My response? “Why not?
         You’re enjoying the learning process, and when you have an interest you
         will do what it takes.” His response? “True,” and then came the reflexive
         smile that momentarily touched his soul. Education and learning should
         make us feel more alive.
     </p>

     <p>
         <b>Dare to be.</b> Know what lies inside of you. Dare to be present.
         Teaching a course, focused on collaboration and software development
         concepts, we would have check-in, for the first ten minutes of class.
         After check-in students would go to work on their assignments, often in
         pairs. For the next 35 minutes, I felt like I had no job. As they worked
         for a couple weeks, I realized that my job was to be present. The
         temptation was to answer E-mail, prep for another class, or grade
         assignments. However the most effective thing was to be available for
         questions, test some code, or listen to ideas.
     </p>

     <p>
         I <i>would like</i> every student to know the joy of taking a journey
         together. Entering collaborative flow states lies at the core of divide
         and conquer, considering, expressing, and thinking about ideas, all in
         a dynamic fluid way. The team accomplishes more; we learn and grow to
         greater heights. We know we’re better connected to each other. We should
         gain a better understanding for who we are individually and for each other.
